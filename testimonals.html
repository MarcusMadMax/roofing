                <h1>HEAR WHAT OUR CLIENTS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ROOF ME</h1>
                <p>We had just purchased a home and knew some of the roof iron had seen better days. We asked Craig to have a look at what was required. We were very pleased with the advice Craig gave us. As some of the existing iron was rusting it was obvious it needed replacing. Craig also identified that some relatively new corrugated iron had been used where rib iron should have been used due to the low pitch. Sure enough when it was removed double sided tape had been applied to all edges in an effort to stop leaks. He also identified that a flashing round the chimney had not been done correctly which resulted in water pooling round the top edge as it could not run off. We also replaced a skylight and Craig willingly assisted with fitting the replacement roof window.

                    Craig’s workmanship is first class, he is obviously a tradesman. We would be happy for our roof to be inspected by any potential client of Craig’s.<br>

                            <p>We have just had Craig and his worker Dale replace an old rusty Brownbuilt roof dating from the 70s. The whole job from start to finish was done extremely competently and promptly. After removing the old roof, Craig carefully checked the fall and then packed one or two purlins where in the past water had tended to pool to make sure this didn’t happen again on this very low-pitched roof. All the barge flashings and guttering were fitted perfectly..<br>
