                <h1>RE-ROOFING</h1>
                <h2>Residential Re-roofing specialists</h2>
                <p>Throughout the lifetime of your home, it’s likely you’ll need to repair or replace your roof to
                    minimise risk any major damage to your property.

                    At Roof Me, we specialise in metal to long run metal re-roofing and concrete to metal re-roofing
                    using quality COLORSTEEL® and ColorCote® products in assorted grades, profiles and colours. These
                    products have been built to deal with New Zealand’s harsh weather conditions, and selected by us for
                    their performance, durability and modern finish.

                    Our experienced team will help you understand what will work best for the requirements of your
                    property, so you can choose products that achieve durable, long-lasting results. When combined with
                    our high standard of workmanship, you can be confident you have a roof designed to withstand
                    whatever the Auckland weather throws at it.

                    Long run comes in a variety of profiles and colour choices, and results in a stylish and
                    dramatically improved finish. Find out more about these roofing products or take a look at some of
                    our re roof projects we’ve completed in our roofing projects gallery.

                    Roof Me us based in Whangaparaoa on the Hibiscus Coast, but services homes throughout the North
                    Shore, and Auckland.

                    How do you know it’s time to re-roof your property?

                    Auckland’s ever-changing weather conditions – like strong sun, damp weather and coastal storms – can
                    begin to take its toll on your roof, undermining performance and leaving it looking tired and
                    damaged. Re-roofing isn’t just about improving the look of your home, but also about ensuring it
                    remains a safe, dry and healthy place to live.

                    Many older roofs were fitted without underlay (roofing paper) and just the addition of this also
                    will achieve a warmer home. This may also be a good time to insulate (which we can carry out and
                    organise) because the roof space is easily accessed at this time. In some cases, the wooden purlins
                    that are part of the substrate structure to which the roofing material is attached can be rotten and
                    may need to be replaced before a new roof is fitted. Doing so will ensure a safe and secure hold for
                    your new roof.

                    Keep and eye out for these signs that your roof needs to be replaced:</p>
