                <h1>Residential Roof Installation</h1>
                <h2>New roofs for new builds, extensions and renovations</h2>
                <p>Protect your new home or extension with a quality long run roof, professionally installed by the
                    experienced team of Auckland roofers from Roof Me.

                    We provide new roof installation for new homes, extensions and garages. We understand that each
                    home, location and environment is unique, so our customised roofing solutions are designed to
                    complement your building and your budget, while taking these important factors into consideration.

                    You can choose Roof Me confidentially for your next build project thanks to our 5-year guarantee on
                    workmanship on all new roofs. As a Licensed Building Practitioner, we’re licensed to install new
                    roofs in Profiled Metal Roof & Wall Cladding (and also Concrete or Clay Tiles).


                    New Metal Profiled Roofing & Cladding (Long Run Roofing)

                    Although roofing materials may look the same in appearance, they may not perform the same long term

                    All our new roofs are installed using quality COLORSTEEL®, ZINCALUME® or ColorCote® products. Long
                    run COLORSTEEL® is one of the best, and most popular, choices for roofing in New Zealand. Not only
                    for its variety of colour options to suit your home, but also for its durability and strength to
                    withstand whatever Auckland’s weather throws at it.

                    Choosing the right roof for your new home is a big decision – after all, you want to make the best
                    choice today that will add both protection and value to your property well into the future. Our team
                    have the expertise to help you decide which roofing products will work best for your new roof taking
                    into account location (marine, coastal, inland), environment (high wind zone), pitch (slope) and
                    talk you through the options available to you.

                    Roof Me is based in Whangaparaoa on the Hibiscus Coast, but services homes throughout the North
                    Shore and Auckland. We’ll provide a free, no-obligation quote for new roof installations.</p>
